Benchmarks for vnncomp 2022, generated from work on Minimum-Error Trajectories

## <a href = "https://github.com/VNNLIB/Benchmarks">Reinforcement Learning</a>

This set of benchmarks is related to classical reinforcement learning problems.

### _Cartpole_

This benchmark is the standard inverted pendulum that must be stabilized

### _Dubins Rejoin_

This benchmark is the problem of making an unmanned aerial vehicle to follow a manned one acting as the lead

### _Lunar Lander_

This benchmark is the rocket trajectory optimization for landing correctly in a given place a two-motor aerial vehicle
